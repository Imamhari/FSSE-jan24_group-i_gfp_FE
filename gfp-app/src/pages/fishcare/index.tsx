                                The foundation of fish care starts with the right tank setup. Ensure you have a tank that suits the size and number of fish you plan to keep.
                                A general rule is to have at least one gallon of water per inch of fish. Use a water filter to maintain clean water, and include plants and hiding spots
                                to mimic the fish's natural habitat.

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                        Water quality is crucial for the health of your fish. Regularly test the water's pH, ammonia, nitrate, and nitrite levels using a water testing kit.
                        The ideal pH level for most decorative fish is between 6.5 and 7.5. Perform partial water changes (about 25%) every two weeks to maintain cleanliness.

                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                        Overfeeding is a common mistake among fish keepers. Feed your fish once or twice a day, providing only as much food as they can consume in a few minutes.
                        Use high-quality fish food, and supplement their diet with fresh or frozen foods such as brine shrimp or bloodworms for variety.

                                When selecting tank mates, it's important to consider the temperament and size of the fish. Aggressive species should not be mixed with peaceful ones,
                                and large fish may prey on smaller fish. Research the species you plan to keep together to ensure compatibility and a stress-free environment.

                        Regular maintenance is key to keeping your fish healthy. Clean the tank walls with an algae scraper, vacuum the substrate to remove debris,
                        and check the filter to ensure it's functioning properly. Regularly inspect your fish for signs of illness, such as changes in behavior, color, or appetite.
